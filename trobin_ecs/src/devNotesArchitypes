Architype management probably is going to require MetaFunctions. Tuples of components too, maybe.
- Rather than hard-coding every possible combination of elements, I could have a MetaFunction that takes a tuple of all the component types and knows how to:
- - calculate size of arrays and
- - lay the arrays of components in its memory block

In MetaPrograms:
decltype(t) returns the typeof t

No std::find
No for/while loops in template metaprograms, use recursion
