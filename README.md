# trobin_ecs
I want to give myself a refresher on working with data structures and the C++ standard library.
I also really like the Entity, Components, and Systems (ECS) design pattern. I decided to make my own.

## What's in the name? 

It's a combination of trout, because they are B+ tier fish, and bin like binary operator because I thought it would be cool to use binary signatures to track and manage archetypes.

Also, Wikipedia said that _Trobin_ is an inflection of _Trobar_ which means cool things in a couple languages:
- "to find" in Occitan, Aragonese, and Catalan
- also "to meet" and "to be located" in Catalan
- "to compose verses or songs" in Galician

Since querying structures of data is such an important part of systems in ECS and song stuff is artistic, the name seemed like a great fit.
