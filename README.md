# trobin_ecs
Practicing architecture (currently a lot of variadic templates) with C++ in the form of a sparse ECS game engine. 
Intended to be a better version of https://github.com/battletrout/SDLPhysics2DPlatformer, which was created following Dave Churchill's COMP4300 series (using SDL2 for rendering instead of SFML). 
Uses CMake instead of visual studio's "filters" and .vcxproj which caused headaches in SDLPhysics2DPlatformer.

## What's in the name? 

It's a combination of trout, and bin like binary operator because I thought it would be cool to use binary signatures to track and manage archetypes.

Also, Wikipedia said that _Trobin_ is an inflection of _Trobar_ which means cool things in a couple languages:
- "to find" in Occitan, Aragonese, and Catalan
- also "to meet" and "to be located" in Catalan
- "to compose verses or songs" in Galician

Since querying structures of data is such an important part of systems in ECS and song stuff is artistic, the name seemed like a great fit.
